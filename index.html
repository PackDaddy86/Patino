                    <h3>Planning for the Future</h3>
                    <p>Comprehensive estate planning to protect your assets and secure your family's future</p>
                    <div class="more-info">
                        <p>Estate planning is an essential step in ensuring your assets and healthcare decisions are handled according to your wishes. We help you create comprehensive estate plans, which include drafting wills to direct the distribution of your property, establishing trusts to protect your assets, and appointing powers of attorney to make medical or financial decisions in the event you become incapacitated.</p>
                        <p>Our team is highly experienced in creating and setting up Special Needs Trusts, which allow families to protect the financial future of loved ones with disabilities while ensuring they remain eligible for essential public benefits. By planning for the future, you can minimize disputes, protect loved ones, and ensure your legacy is preserved.</p>

Whether dealing with debts, assets, or resolving disputes, we help ease the burden during this difficult time.</p>

                    <h3>Special Needs Trusts</h3>
                    <p>Specialized trusts to provide for loved ones with special needs</p>
                    <div class="more-info">
                        <p>A Special Needs Trust (SNT) is a powerful tool for individuals with disabilities, ensuring they receive the care and support they need without losing eligibility for critical government benefits such as Medicaid or Supplemental Security Income (SSI). We assist families in setting up these trusts, which can protect assets while allowing beneficiaries to maintain access to necessary services. Whether you‚Äôre planning for a child with special needs or an adult with disabilities, a special needs trust ensures their quality of life is supported long-term without jeopardizing essential public benefits.</p>
                        <p>First Party Special Needs Trusts (D4A Trusts): These trusts are funded with assets that belong to the beneficiary, such as an inheritance or personal injury settlement. The trust ensures that the beneficiary can still qualify for government benefits like Medicaid and SSI. Upon the beneficiary‚Äôs death, any remaining funds in the trust may be used to pay back Medicaid for services provided, with the remainder going to other beneficiaries under certain circumstances. This trust is particularly useful when a person with disabilities receives a large sum of money or assets, but still needs to rely on government assistance for daily living and medical care.</p>
                        <p>Third Party Special Needs Trusts: These trusts are funded by someone other than the beneficiary, typically a parent, grandparent, or other family member. A third party trust allows the beneficiary to receive the financial benefits of the trust without losing eligibility for public benefits. Unlike a first-party trust, there are no Medicaid payback requirements upon the beneficiary‚Äôs death, and the remaining funds can be distributed to other family members or beneficiaries according to the trust‚Äôs terms. Third-party trusts are ideal for planning for a loved one‚Äôs future needs, as they protect their benefits while also ensuring financial support after the creator‚Äôs passing.</p>

                        <p>Guardianship planning is crucial for families with minor children or adult dependents who need ongoing assistance.
